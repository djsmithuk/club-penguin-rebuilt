If you've made your way into this directory Riley, Alex, or Connor, your curiosity is strong ;o.

I'm keeping backups of SWFs in here that I think we could use in the future
for example:
pufflepenguins.swf
you'd rename pufflepenguins.swf to penguin.swf is /global and instead of being penguins, you're a puffle. Just a fun thing to do for a party. :3 Don't break anything please Connor
